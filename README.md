# Farmer Emils Webshop - my very first PERN App!
PERN - PostgreSQL - express.js - React.js - Node.js (+ Redux!)
Mimicking a classic webshop, the data is loaded from the database to the server and routed to the frontend.
So far you can view items and add them to a cart - a proper check-out including registration and login is in the works
(as can be seen by the barebones code existing already for it).

## Running the app
You will need PostgreSQL installed on your computer as well as the necessary database structure which I will provide soon!
Make sure to create a .env file with the necessary credentials such as the provided "yourenvfile.env" in the root folder.
Open the console in the root folder and run "npm i", do so in the backend folder as well. Once everything is installed you
can prompt the command "npm run dev" in the root folder, your website should automatically open in your browser.
Otherwise you can access it via "http://localhost:[your specified port]"

## Next steps
As I already wrote a lot of code for: checkout, registration, user login, viewing orders these features are
going to be implemented next. Can't wait to share these with you!
